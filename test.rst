Release 3.0b4
-------------
**Download:**

* [1541 Ultimate-II 3.0 beta 4](Firmware/1541u2_3.0beta4.zip) (local)
* **SHA256:** 4ac8fad3ab2ad608b7e159c9ddfbf3dd4f31a2dbda8af8a58e781d75cbdb6ee8

**Changes in this release:**

* The FPGA platform has gotten an upgrade. There is now a faster RISC processor
  on board (~10 times faster), and I have re-written the USB host controller,
  which has become ~50 times faster. The external memory of the FPGA also runs
  faster, and delivers now also approx. 7 times more bandwidth. With this
  faster platform, it has become possible to run a multithreaded OS.
* There is now support for USB2LAN adapters, and 3.0beta4 runs two services: a
  (raw-)telnet (VT100) server that brings up the menu, and an FTP daemon for
  basic file transfer.
* There is now support for reading the directories of D71 and D81 files in the
  browser.
* There is a 'CD' command in the software IEC, and other improvements have been
  made to the soft IEC driver.
* There is now a copy command in the file browser, that works with C=C/C=V (or
  CTRL-C / CTRL-V). It is not that fast, but for small files it works. You can
  also copy files from inside a D64/T64 to another location in the file system.
  The other way around is still under development, but will soon be possible as
  well.

*UltiCopy is disabled for now, because it still needs to be ported to the
multi-threaded operating system.*

Version 2.6d contains some small fixes on top of 2.6c.

**Release notes 2.6d:**

* Ultimax mode forced now correctly implemented (solves issue with freeze and DMA load)* Programmable cartrige emulation timing* Some drive emulation enhancements
* FIXED: Ultimax mode forced now correctly implemented (solves issue with freeze and DMA load)
* FIXED: Updater now works on C128... (not all C128 issues are fixed)
* ADDED: Programmable cartrige emulation timing
* IMPROVED: Some drive emulation enhancements

**Release notes 2.6c:**

* This version does include SID, but is just single-drive. It does include the Ultimate Audio module. Different builds may become available upon request.
* FIXED: USB stick present on boot time caused the Ultimate-II to crash when loading a file from SD at initialisation time (kernal rom / drive rom)
* FIXED: Starting a program with RUN sometimes caused the ultimate to become unresponsive when freezing afterwards.

* See for additional information the release notes of firmware V2.6


1541U-II Update 2.6
-------------------
**Download:**

* [1541 Ultimate-II V2.6](http://www.1541ultimate.net/content/download/1541u2_2.6.zip) (1541ultimate.net)
* [1541 Ultimate-II V2.6](Firmware/1541u2_2.6.zip) (local)
* **SHA256:** 2bd8f9ce9936d98ca61174fbf0463b7066b68532126586a41d5925e3b811ffb0

**Version 2.6 includes some new features:**

* Disk Copier from real drives to .D64 images
* Command Interface
* Ultimate-II DOS V1.0 (command target)
* Kernal replacement function

**... and some important fixes, including:**

* TAP file recorder failed miserably on high latency write devices. Rewritten; should work better now.
* Drive data timing has improved. Timing is now dependent on the data track itself, not on the speed setting of the VIA. This fixes some protected titles in G64 format.

**Release information:**

* This version does *not* include SID, but it does include the Ultimate Audio module. Different builds may become available upon request.
* The internal copier is still in beta. It has been tested with some of my drives, but there might be drives out there that won't work. Make sure you have an IEC link from the Ultimate to a real drive to use this function. (No need to have a link to the computer.) There is still no retry mechanism; sectors that failed to read correctly will not be re-read.
* The Kernal replacement function is critical when it comes to timing. Tested on two machines only. Might not work on C128.

**Installation instructions:**

* Unzip the downloaded file into the root of your SD card.
* Place the SD card in the 1541Ultimate II.
* Boot your Commodore machine
* Wait for instructions and remove SD after flashing. Suggestion: remove 'update.bin' from the root of the SD, using the PC or the delete command in the Ultimate.

***Command Interface and Ultimate-II DOS***

See the [documentation](Documentation/command_interface_v1.0.pdf) of the Command Interface module for knowing how to use it!

See the [documentation](Documentation/ultimate_dos_v1.0.pdf) of the Ultimate-II DOS, to get to know what you can do with the Command Interface in this firmware release.

**Version 2.5 includes some new features:**

* File viewer
* Selectable colors in user interface

Version **2.5** also includes some fixes for nasty memory allocation bugs that existed when using USB sticks. Removal of a USB device is now at least a lot safer. :-) Also, some file system bugs were fixed.

**Installation instructions:**

* Unzip the downloaded file into the root of your SD card.
* Place the SD card in the 1541Ultimate II.
* Boot your Commodore machine
* Wait for instructions and remove SD after flashing. Suggestion: remove 'update.bin' from the root of the SD, using the PC or the delete command in the Ultimate.

_***Ultimate Audio module***_

There is also a special version of 2.5; including a special 7-voice audio engine. This version, based on the same 2.5 with the bugfixes can be downloaded here:

* [1541 Ultimate-II V2.5+](http://www.1541ultimate.net/content/download/1541u2_2.5_uaud.zip) (1541ultimate.net)

See the [documentation](Documentation/ultimate_audio_v0.2.pdf) of the Ultimate
Audio module for knowing how to use it!

**Version 2.5+ is a special FPGA build; it only supports ONE floppy drive, in
favor of extra audio functionality.**


Release 2.4a / 2.4c 1541U1/II Update

**Installation instructions:**

**For 1541U-I:**

* Unzip the downloaded file into the root of your SD card.
* Place the SD card in the 1541Ultimate I/II.
* Boot your Commodore machine

**For 1541U-II:**

* Wait for instructions and remove SD after flashing. <br> Suggestion: remove
  'update.bin' from the root of the SD, using the PC or the delete command in
  the Ultimate.

**Version 2.4c includes the fixes that TLR made to the firmware, and adds the following features:**

* CRT load (just by selecting the file, not on boot time);
* EasyFlash support (reading only, writing is not yet implemented and is under
  discussion);
* Flashing and running custom FPGAs (Ultimate-II only), especially for those
  who want to do FPGA development without JTAG cable. FPGA bitfile will be
  flashed into the spare area of the Flash memory device, and the FPGA is
  booted from there. So there is no risk of bricking your device. (Flashing
  needs to be done for every boot still, optimizations will follow.)
* For the rest, a lot of work has been done 'under the hood'; especially in
  preparation of a native command interface to control the Ultimate from I/O
  space. But since this is not yet ready, it's not included (=not enabled) in
  the 2.4 firmware.

.. note:: 2.4a and 2.4c are the same, except for the update program
          itself.
