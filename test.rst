   environment
      A structure where information about all documents under the root is
      saved, and used for cross-referencing.  The environment is pickled
      after the parsing stage, so that successive runs only need to read
      and parse new and changed documents.

   source directory
      The directory which, including its subdirectories, contains all
      source files for one Sphinx project.

.. sidebar:: Sidebar Title
    :subtitle: Optional Sidebar Subtitle

    Subsequent indented lines comprise
    the body of the sidebar, and are
    interpreted as body elements.
